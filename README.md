# Spittoon
Because JSON had too much baggage, CSV was too flat, TOON too quirky in the brackets, and we needed something with actual spit. Terse, human-readable, hierarchical + tabular-ready serialization: comma-or-semicolon separators, optional SSCH schema validation, and a mullet that’s strictly business in the front, pure party in the back.
